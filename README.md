# Tic Tac Toe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented with vanilla js and riotjs.

This project is meant to be a simplistic implementation of the game.
The main goal is to write the frontend first (riot-tags, css, html)
and then write the backend-logic through TDD.

It is by no means meant to be pretty or responsive
The main focus is the game-logic.
