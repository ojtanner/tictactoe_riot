# Tic Tac Toe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented with vanilla js and riotjs.

### This small website was implemented with:
* Webpack 4 for bundling and the Dev Server
* Jest for TDD
* Riot.js for modular and reusable html

---

### What i have learned from this project:
* Webpack is hard and complicated. I probably should do the Sean Larking Webpack Academy at some point in the future.
* TDD rocks! I kinda started writing the logic first and forgetting about TDD, but once i caught up and actually started doing it, it gave me a huge confidence boost. This may be a small app, but TDD helped me actually test the behaviour of the GameLogic object and find lots and lots of errors and oversights on my part.
* Riot.js is ok for small projects, but i would like to learn a more mature technology like Vue or React.
